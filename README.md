# SlapBot Stewie
SlapBot stewie is a clash of clans leagues administration bot for [FTHL]().
Slapbot was introduced at the start of FTHL season 4. This project aims to be the best 
clash of clans leagues bot.

## Features
- Create a league
- Register teams
- Create roster
- Make roster changes
- Manipulate every field for a team, (Team representative, Clan tag, Clan abbreviation)
 and much more!


## Where can I find it?
Either by joining [FTHL](https://discord.gg/x5jKUVkMWm) or by inviting the bot to your own server

## When will it be public?

As of right now I have no plans to make the project open source. It will stay a close
project for some time before I figure out what to do!?

## What technology does SlapBot uses?
Slapbot always uses the latest public release of [javacord](https://javacord.org/), development may use 
Snapshot version of javacord for testing, but it's not recommenced to use the dev branch to 
public the bot.

SlapBot also used the latest version of spring boot to manage dependency injection.

Lastly it uses JClash, a custom open source java clash of clans wrapper with dynamic key handling which was developed by me 
after not having a static Ip for my home testing environment. Read more about JClash [here](https://github.com/SaHHiiLL/JClash).
